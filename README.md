## User Story

- AS A marketing agency
- I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
- SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code
- THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
